# FAQ

This page answers common questions from parents and teachers.

## For teachers

### How do I use it in the classroom?

Use Classroom Mode for low‑noise sessions focused on one country/topic. Run a short quest (5–15 minutes), then do a quick debrief: rebuild the knowledge graph, compare with real‑world resources, or have students explain a card to a partner.  
Check the dedicated [classroom page](./classroom_guide.md).

### How do I track learning and progress?

The Book shows collected cards and achievements. A teacher-facing summary highlights progress and key events (e.g., bonus/malus). Each quest also has a page summarizing topics, cards, and activities to support lesson planning.

### How long is a typical session?

One quest (5–15 minutes) plus a 5–10 minute discussion or extension activity.

### Can it align with my curriculum?

Yes. Topics, cards, and activities are transparent and easy to map to learning goals. You can select quests that fit your unit and use the Book to review knowledge.

### How do I give feedback or validate a quest?

Use the quest’s page on the website or the community forum to report what worked, what didn’t, and suggestions for improvement. Classroom feedback helps validate content and adjust difficulty.

### Can I contribute or create new quests?

Yes. Discover with Antura is built on an open framework and educators and designers can propose new topics, cards, words, and quest ideas; advanced users can build full quests.
Check the [Quets design guides](../dev/quest-design/index.md)

## For parents

### What ages is it for?

Recommended for ages 6–12. Younger or older learners can still enjoy it with guidance.

### How long should my child play?

One quest takes about 5–15 minutes. Short, focused sessions work best; you can always replay quests to discover hidden content.

### Is my child’s data safe?

By default, the game focuses on learning summaries (progress, cards, achievements) rather than personal data. If you export data for research or school reporting, follow your school’s privacy policies.

### What devices does it run on? Can we play offline?

PC/Mac and tablets are supported. Offline play works after installation.

### How can I support learning at home?

- Play together for 15–20 minutes and talk about what you discover.
- Ask your child to open the Book and explain one card in their own words.
- Encourage repeating new words aloud and using them in short sentences.
