2. **Educational Support for Schools and Teachers:** By offering a digital educational tool and a pedagogical methodology, the project supports educators in integrating the game into classroom activities effectively.
3. **Game Replicability:** The game is designed to be adaptable, allowing it to be used in various countries and contexts, making it a versatile tool for different educational settings.
4. **Insights into Digital Tools:** The project also seeks to provide valuable insights into how digital educational tools can be used during crises, such as the Ukrainian refugee crisis.

### Project Activities

The ANTURA project will undertake several key activities to achieve its objectives:

- **Development of the Mobile Game:** A mobile game will be created to teach language and cultural context in a fun and engaging way. The game will be freely available and open-source, ensuring wide accessibility.
- **Pilot Testing:** The game will be piloted in both small and large-scale trials in France and Poland. These pilots will help refine the game before its broader release.
- **Teacher Training and Toolkit Development:** A comprehensive toolkit will be developed to assist teachers in integrating the game into their curriculum. This will include training materials and guidelines.
- **Promotion and Scaling:** The project will promote the game widely, preparing it for distribution across different countries and educational contexts.

### Expected Results

By the end of the project, several tangible outcomes are expected:

- **Interactive Mobile Game:** A multilingual, open-source game that fosters language learning and cultural integration.
- **Teacher Toolkit:** A resource for educators to effectively use the game in their teaching practices.
- **Impact Evaluation Report:** An assessment of the game’s effectiveness in improving language skills and psychosocial well-being among the children.
- **Replicability Manual:** A guide to help adapt the game to various contexts, ensuring its long-term usefulness and adaptability.

### Long-Term Benefits

The ANTURA project is poised to make a lasting impact on the lives of refugee and migrant children by improving their integration into new societies. The open-source nature of the game, combined with a detailed replicability manual, ensures that this tool can be adapted and used across different educational settings, providing a valuable resource during crises. The collaborative efforts of the diverse partner organizations involved will ensure that the project is developed and implemented successfully, ultimately contributing to the inclusion and integration of vulnerable children across Europe.

This project exemplifies how digital innovation can be harnessed to address some of the most pressing educational challenges of our time, offering hope and support to those who need it most.
