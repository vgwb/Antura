# Workshops in Wrocław, Poland

In February 2024, the ANTURA project team conducted a series of engaging workshops in Wrocław, Poland, marking a significant step in the development and refinement of the ANTURA educational game. These workshops aimed to gather valuable feedback from teachers, parents, and children, helping to shape the game into an effective tool for language learning and cultural integration for refugee and migrant children.

## Workshop Highlights

The workshops were organized by a dedicated team from various partner organizations, including Jan Stasieńko, Agnieszka Dytman Stasieńko, and Maciej Śledź from Dolnośląska Szkoła Wyższa, as well as Maria Zielińska from Ogólnopolski Operator Oświaty. The sessions took place at Leonardo Elementary School over two days, with each day focused on different groups of participants.

## Day 1: Teachers' Workshop (February 20, 2024)
On the first day, the team met with two Polish and three Ukrainian teachers to present the current version of the ANTURA game and gather their feedback. The teachers provided insightful suggestions on how the game could better support language learning and cultural education. They expressed appreciation for the game's educational potential, particularly its intuitive gameplay and dual-language delivery. However, they also recommended specific enhancements, such as the inclusion of written letters and improved phonetics, to further aid the children's learning process.

## Day 2: Workshop with Parents, Caregivers, and Children (February 21, 2024)
The second day was dedicated to engaging with parents, caregivers, and children. A total of ten families participated, including children from Ukraine and Belarus. During the session, children interacted with the ANTURA game while parents filled out surveys and participated in discussions about the game’s use in their children's education. The involvement of a Ukrainian-speaking teacher greatly facilitated communication, making the workshop a positive and productive experience for all.

Parents showed great enthusiasm for the ANTURA game, with many downloading it on their phones during the workshop. They recognized the game's potential to help their children overcome language barriers and expressed a keen interest in its cultural content. The workshop concluded with parents and children playing the game together, which fostered a deeper connection and reinforced positive feelings towards the project.

## Key Takeaways

The workshops in Wrocław provided the ANTURA project team with crucial feedback and ideas for future updates. Some of the key takeaways include:

- **Game Enhancements**: Suggestions for including written letters, improving phonetics, and adding more dynamic content to keep older children engaged.
- **Cultural Content**: The importance of integrating cultural education into the game, with parents and teachers both highlighting the need for content related to local traditions, holidays, and social norms.
- **Parental Involvement**: The positive response from parents underscores the importance of involving caregivers in the educational process, which can significantly enhance the learning experience for children.

These workshops represent a vital part of the ANTURA project’s ongoing development, ensuring that the final product will be a powerful and effective tool for supporting the integration and education of refugee and migrant children across Europe. The team is now focused on implementing the feedback and preparing for the next phases of the project. Stay tuned for more updates!
