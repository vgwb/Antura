# Kick off meeting - Cologne, Germany

On 7th December 2023, the ANTURA project officially kicked off with a successful meeting held in Cologne, Germany. This first working meeting brought together the consortium members to officially launch the project and lay the groundwork for the exciting journey ahead.

The meeting was hosted by the lead organization, Technische Hochschule Köln, and was attended by representatives from all partner organizations, including Videojuegos Sin Fronteras from Spain, Dolnośląska Szkoła Wyższa from Poland, Ogólnopolski Operator Oświaty from Poland, and Académie de Nantes Rectorat from France.

During this inaugural session, the consortium members discussed and finalized the project’s action plan, setting the stage for the next three years of collaboration. The key milestones and stages necessary for the successful implementation of the ANTURA project were meticulously planned, ensuring that all partners are aligned and ready to move forward.

The meeting also served as an opportunity for the consortium to strengthen their working relationships, establish communication protocols, and ensure that everyone is committed to the shared vision of supporting the integration of refugee and migrant children through the innovative ANTURA mobile game.

The enthusiasm and commitment shown by all partners at this kick-off meeting signal a promising start to the ANTURA project. The consortium is now fully equipped and motivated to begin the hard work of developing and implementing this groundbreaking educational tool, which will have a lasting impact on the lives of vulnerable children across Europe.

Stay tuned for more updates as the project progresses!
