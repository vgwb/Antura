## Canvas

- Skills: Coordination_Timing, Fine_Motor_Control, Attention_Divided, Visual_Discrimination

A 2D minigame where the player is tasked with dragging a finger across the screen to clean a canvas. There will be obstacles scattered around the screen, moving between two points at varying speeds depending on the difficulty. If the player touches at least 1 of them, a point will be deducted once the minigame is finished (the amount of points deducted does not increase as the player makes more mistakes). A point will also be deducted upon skipping the minigame. There may be treasures hidden under the line: when the player traces over them, they are revealed and glow a little. The player can pick them up by tapping them.
Input Variable: Background image and the images of the moving obstacles
