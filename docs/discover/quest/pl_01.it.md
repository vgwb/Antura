### Flow

You are greeted in Warsaw, the capital of Poland by the Guide. He asks you for your help. It seems that Antura has been creating chaos since it arrived here and somebody needs to stop it and fix it. He points you in the direction of the Mermaid of Warsaw.

**Mermaid of Warsaw**  
You meet with the Mermaid of Warsaw, who is missing her sword. She tells you that she saw Antura disturb other monuments of Warsaw and tried to stop him but in the process he managed to take her sword away. She asks you to retrieve it, and help other monuments while you follow Antura’s trail. She points you to the Chopin Monument. She also asks you if you know how the transportation works in Warsaw and explains the vocabulary and types of transport.

**Chopin Monument**  
Once you find the Chopin Monument, you can see that it seems the music notes to his music piece are missing. To get them back, you have to recreate the melody. 
[Activity Piano]
When you do, Chopin’s statue thanks you and tells you about himself.  He also tells you that he saw Antura with the Mermaid’s sword going in the direction of Nicolaus Copernicus’ Monument.

**Wars and Sawa statue**  
Once you get there, you meet with Wars. Apparently Sawa seems to be missing and he is asking you to find her. Once you follow her trail, you can see her by the Wisła river. You learn about the river from Sawa and convince her to go back to Wars. She says they got separated during the chaos that Antura was creating. Once you go back with her, they tell you the legend about them and the origin of the city. They also say that you should head in the direction of King Sigismund’s Column.

**King Sigismund’s Column**
When you go to King Sigismund’s Column, he greets you and introduces himself. He explains that he used to be a king of Poland and tells you about the Royal Castle, later mentioning that right now the country is governed by the Parliament. He asks you to find his missing crown [task] which has been knocked off his head while Antura was running by. It is not far from him. Once you complete the task, he tells you to go to the Sejm, since apparently that is where the Mermaid’s Sword has been left.

**President and Houses of Parliament**  
Once you go there, you meet the President who explains what the Polish Houses of Parliament are and tells you about the Presidential Palace. He says he has the Mermaid’s sword, but before you go to give it back to her, he asks you to help with a little thing. Apparently Antura stole the colours from the Polish flag and needs you to give them back. You then learn how the Polish flag looks and need to choose the correct colours for the flag. The President thanks you for your help.  He wants to share some more facts with you and asks you if you know about the 3 May Constitution Day in Poland. He then explains what it means. 

**Mermaid of Warsaw**
You go back to the Mermaid of Warsaw and you give back her sword. She tells you, she is a symbol of Warsaw and tells you about herself. Then she says that she has heard Antura has also messed with a few other places. She points you to the Palace of Culture and Science. 

**Palace of Culture and Science and Maria Skłodowska-Curie**
Once you get there, you meet Maria Skłodowska-Curie. She explains that although she is not associated with this place, it is called The Palace of Culture and Science and she herself is connected to scientific fields. She explains its role today and tells a little bit about herself. She also asks you for a favor. Antura seems to have misplaced her wallet. She asks you to retrieve it and you need to follow the trail of coins that are polish złoty until you find it and bring it back. She thanks you and explains that in Poland this is the currency. She also says that she has heard some commotion at the National Stadium.

**National Stadium and national anthem**
You go to the  National Stadium, where you meet Robert Lewandowski. He tells you a little about the Stadium and you are challenged by him to score 5 goals (minigame) to cheer everybody up after Antura’s visit. 

When you manage to do it, he explains to you some vocabulary associated with sport. The people at the stadium also sing the national anthem and Robert Lewandowski tells you about the Independence Day in Poland that takes place on the 11th of November. 
Then the Guide comes and he says that you have managed to clear the commotion that Antura left behind him. In the meantime Antura seems to have left the city.
