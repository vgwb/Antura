## Game Design Notes

Prepare for an alpine adventure! Help The cat select the right gear for changing weather as he climbs Mont Blanc, the highest peak in the Alps, and learn about the countries that surround it.

At each section, the player must open Cat's backpack and choose the correct clothing to proceed safely. The quest culminates in a flag-placing puzzle at the peak, followed by a fun bobsled ride down.

**Location**  
Mont Blanc, French Alps - Mountain peak

**Base Camp \- The Preparation:** The quest starts at a base camp at the foot of Mont Blanc. The Mountain Guide greets Cat.

- **Guide:** "Bonjour, mountaineer\! Ready to climb Mont Blanc, the highest peak in the Alps? The weather on the mountain can change quickly, so you must be prepared. I've packed your bag with all the essential gear. I'm also entrusting you with these three flags to place at the summit. Let's begin\!"  
  - The player is shown the backpack UI, filled with the 5 clothing items.

**The Ascent \- A Series of Challenges:** The player starts moving up a winding path.

- **Challenge 1 (The Windy Pass):** The environment becomes windy (visual effects and sound). The Cat shivers.  
  - **Guide's Voice-over:** "Brrr, that wind is biting\! Open your backpack and put on something to protect yourself. You should have a coat and a hat."  
    - **Puzzle:** The player must open the backpack UI and select the **Coat** and **Scarf**. Once selected, the Cat puts them on, and can proceed.  
  - **Challenge 2 (The Snow Line):** It begins to snow heavily. Along this part of the path, the player sees NPCs **skiing**.  
    - **Guide's Voice-over:** "Snow\! It's beautiful but cold. You'll need your warmest layers now\!"  
    - **Puzzle:** The player must open the backpack and select the **Hat** and **Gloves**.  
  - **Challenge 3 (The Sun-Glacier):** The path crosses a wide, snowy field where the sun is intensely bright. The player sees NPCs **hiking** with poles and sunglasses.  
    - **Guide's Voice-over:** "The sun's reflection on the snow can be blinding\! Protect your eyes."  
    - **Puzzle:** The player must select the **Sunglasses**.

**The Summit:** The player reaches the peak. The view is spectacular. A signpost reads **"Mont Blanc: 4807m"**. The Mountain Guide is waiting for them. Near the sign are three empty flagpoles.

  - The Guide gives the player the first flag (France), then the second (Switzerland) and then the last one (Italy). Hint?
