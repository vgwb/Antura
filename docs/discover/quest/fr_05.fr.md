Journey to the Loire Valley and help Cat find the perfect outfits to visit two very different castles: a strong defensive fortress and a magnificent royal palace. 

Medieval adventure exploring French castle heritage. Discover defensive architecture at Chinon and royal luxury at Chambord while collecting knight equipment and prince items. Learn about drawbridges, parapets, medieval life, and Loire Valley's 200+ castles.

### Mission
The player must visit two distinct castles on the Loire river. In each castle, they will embark on a scavenger hunt to find a complete outfit that is appropriate for that castle's function (a knight's armor in the defensive castle, a prince's finery in the pleasure castle). By finding the items, the player explores and learns the purpose of each castle's unique architecture.
