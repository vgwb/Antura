# Install and Configure

## Requirements

- Unity latest 2020, Mac or Windows computer

## Fetch the Project

1. Get Unity latest 2020 stable (Win or Mac) from <https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive>
2. Download the project. There are two ways:
    A) the **simple** is to download the zipped package (from Clone or Download green button)
    B) the **advanced** is to use a Git client to track the changes and update the project as it gets developed:
    - Install a free GitHub client (<https://fork.dev/> and <https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/> are good for developers, <https://desktop.github.com/> is a simpler one for anybody)
    - fetch the project from this repository <https://github.com/vgwb/Antura_arabic> (you can read <https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/getting-started/> for some help using GitHub Desktop)
3. **Play**. Open the project in Unity and open scene `_app/_scenes/app_Bootstrap` and press Play ;)

## Editor Setup

set the Build Setup to Desktop, iOS or Android platform.

then set the Game window to **16:9** (under iOS there is a preset called iPhone 5 Wide (16:9))
