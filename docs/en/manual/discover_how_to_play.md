# How to play Discover quests <Badge type="tip" text="new" />

## Choose a quest

- Start from the Earth menu and select a country or a Location Pin (generally a town).  
- Pick a quest to see its title, a short description and its content.  
- In Classroom mode: your teacher may lock the country and let you choose any quest inside.  
- In Home mode: quests usually unlock one by one. Replaying improves your score and reveals extra cards.  

> [!tip] 
> If you’re new, start with the tutorial quest in each country.  

## Player controls

**PC / Desktop**  

- ASDW keys = move (hold 2 seconds to run)  
- SPACE = jump / interact / advance dialogues  
- SHIFT = run (secret, since it's not mandatory)  
- Mouse + right button = move camera  
- Mouse left button = interact  

**Touch**  

- Left finger = move (hold 2 seconds to run)  
- Button = jump / interact  
- Tap objects = interact  
- Tap and drag on screen = move camera  

> [!tip] Classroom tip
> Project controls on the board for the first session. Pair students so one reads prompts while the other controls, then swap roles.  

## Map and tasks

- Map button: opens a simple map with your current position and main objective.  
- Target point: a waypoint marker and guiding beam show where to go next.  
- Task panel: short text hints appear on screen when the goal changes (e.g., “Talk to the Baker”).  

> [!tip] Classroom tip
> Ask students to restate the current objective in their own words before moving.  

## Interaction types

- **Talk**: approach an character and press interact to start a short dialogue.
- **Look**: look at signs, posters, or objects to unlock knowledge cards in the Book.  
- **Collect**: pick up items that go into the inventory (auto‑use when needed).  
- **Use**: press buttons, levers, or floor switches to open doors or trigger events.  
- **Navigate**: jump across platforms, avoid hazards, follow safe paths (e.g., cross on green).  
- **Activities**: some interactions launch an activity (see below) to practice a card or a skill.  

 > [!note] 
 > Interact is the same button as Jump when close to an NPC/object.

## Inventory and items

- Up to 5 quick slots; items disappear when used for their task.  

## Progress and rewards

- **Stars**: overall quest score (3 = perfect).  
- **Knowledge cards**: unlocked by exploring, talking, reading signs, and finishing tasks.  
- **Gems**: mastery currency earned by completing quests and special cards.  
- **Cookies**: fun currency used to buy cosmetic props.  
- **Achievements**: milestones like “Finish 3 quests” or “Collect 20 cards.”  
- **Bonus/Malus**: good actions (talking to NPCs, cleaning) vs. risky actions (crossing on red, trampling flowers).
