## Send us the Player Log (Windows)

When something goes wrong, the game writes a log file we can read to diagnose the issue.

### Player Log

1. Press **Win + R** on your keyboard to open “Run…”.
2. Paste this and press **Enter**:

```shell
%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\VGWB\Antura
```

3. You should see a file called `Player.log` (and sometimes `Player-prev.log`).
4. Right-click → Send to → Compressed (zipped) folder.
5. Email us the .zip.


If you don’t see the “AppData” folder: in File Explorer click View → Show → Hidden items.

### Crash log
If the game crashed, please check if the “Crashes” folder exists at the folowing path and send the newest crash folder too:

1. Press **Win + R** on your keyboard to open “Run…”.
2. Paste this and press **Enter**:

```shell
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Temp\VGWB\Antura
```
3. Check if there is folder called "Crashes"
4. if it exists, please Zip and send us the most recent subfolder (it contains error.log, crash.dmp, etc.)
