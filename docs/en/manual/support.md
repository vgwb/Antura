## Report a problem

Each quest has a dedicated area in our community forum where you can share feedback, bugs, and ideas. Please check the corresponding link from [quest pages](../content/quests/index.md)

**What to include:**

- Your device/OS (e.g., PC latptop with Windows 11, iPad with iPadOS version 15), and the game version/build date
- Clear steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected result vs. actual result
- Screenshots or a short video, if possible

## Send us the Player Log (Windows)

When something goes wrong, the game writes a log file we can read to diagnose the issue.

### Player Log

1. Press **Win + R** on your keyboard to open “Run…”.
2. Paste this and press **Enter**:

```shell
%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow
```

3. Open the folder named `VGWB`, then `Antura`
4. You should see a file called `Player.log` (and sometimes `Player-prev.log`).
5. Right-click → Send to → Compressed (zipped) folder.
6. Email us the .zip.


If you don’t see the “AppData” folder: in File Explorer click View → Show → Hidden items.

### Crash log
If the game crashed and a “Crashes” folder exists, send the newest crash folder too:

- Path:

```shell
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Temp\VGWB\Antura\Crashes
```

- Zip the most recent subfolder (it contains error.log, crash.dmp, etc.)
