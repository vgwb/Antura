Here we describe the major features of the game.  
Once installed, the game doesn’t need internet connection.  
Since the game is free and Open Source, it can be installed as many times without limits, and anybody can help improve it by reporting problems / bugs, suggesting ideas, spreading the word, or developing new levels and code\!

#### Player Account

Every player should have a personal account. It can be created by pressing the \+ button in the home page and configuring the personal avatar.  
The account lives only on the device where it is created 

NOTE: all profile data aren’t shared with external companies and no personal data is collected at all.

Here you can create a TEACHER PROFILE, who has everything unlocked.  
And you can set the game in **Classroom Mode**

##### Classroom Mode

This mode will

- reduce volume / sound fx, useful when several devices are playing in the same room.  
- **unlock all levels in language modules**, so any of them can be selected. (the teacher can ask the player to “play that level” without worrying if it’s was unlocked or not)  
- Allow the teacher to edit **username** and **class code** for each profile, to easy identification.
