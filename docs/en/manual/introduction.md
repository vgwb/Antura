# Introduction

Learn with Antura is an award-winning open source game that turns reading, language, and culture into a fun adventure.
Designed specifically for migrant children, Antura can be installed on the family phone for autonomous learning or it can be used in the classroom (mainly on tablets and PCs) to help their integration a new country. Within the mark of the [ANTURA Erasmus+ project](../about/erasmus/index.md), this manual we will focus on the latter: how to test the game in the classroom, both in France and Poland, and how to provide feedback about it.

The game currently supports 2 main types of curriculums:

- **Learn Languages**: an introduction to a foreign language
- **Discover a Country and its Culture**: to help the integration of migrant kids in the host country
