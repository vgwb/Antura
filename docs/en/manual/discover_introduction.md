Discover Europe helps children explore the culture, language, and daily life of different countries through short, replayable quests.

It is designed to support **migrant children**, but can also be used in any school to promote **cultural awareness** and **language learning**.

- **Where to use it**: in class or at home
- **For whom**: children aged 6–12
- **Values**: simple, safe, accessible

Here is a short introduction to the game, followed by a detailed description of each feature.

## The game in 2 minutes

- Children play as a **Cat character** in colorful 3D worlds.
- They take on **Quests** (5–15 minutes each), which are short adventures focusing on cultural or educational themes.
- Each quest combines:
    - exploration of authentic places
    - meeting characters
    - solving puzzles and mini-games
    - collecting cultural elements (**Knowledge Cards**)

### Language support

- All dialogues are bilingual: **the child’s native language** + **the host country’s language** (e.g., Polish, French).
- This makes it easier for children to follow the story while learning new words and phrases.

### Learning through play

Discover teaches in two ways:

1. **Indirect learning**: children absorb culture and language while exploring and playing.
2. **Direct learning**: short questions and quizzes reinforce knowledge before advancing.

Topics include history, food, traditions, geography, daily life, and more.

### Knowledge cards & Book

- **Cards**: represent facts, people, objects, traditions, or places.
- Children **collect them in quests** and can review them anytime in the **Book**.
- Cards are linked into a **Knowledge Graph** that shows how cultural elements connect (e.g., baguette → bread → French cuisine).

### Motivation & Progress

- **Gems** = mastery of tasks (real learning progress).
- **Cookies** = fun currency for customizing the cat.
- **Stars** = performance rating of each quest.
- **Achievements** = long-term goals (e.g., “collect all cards in France”).

### Teacher & parent tools

- **Teacher Panel**: adjust difficulty, choose language mode, monitor quests and progress.
- **Automatic Website**: shows topics, cards, and activities completed, aligning gameplay with the **curriculum** and making progress **transparent** for teachers and parents.

### Skills developed

While playing, kids train:

- memory and recall
- logical reasoning
- spatial orientation
- language comprehension and production
- cultural awareness and citizenship

### Classroom Integration

After playing, teachers can:

- rebuild the knowledge graph with students
- extend it with new ideas
- retell the quest together
- compare with real-life resources (maps, books, visits)

### Value

- helps children **feel at home in a new country**
