# Classroom guide

This guide provides some practical suggestions for teachers who want to use **Learn with Antura** in class, that means:  

1. Playing together, in groups, or individually.  
2. Extending play with **reflection and research activities**.  
3. Involving parents to strengthen learning at home.  
4. Providing feedback to help improve and validate quests.  

Together, this creates a **loop of play → reflection → feedback → improvement**, ensuring the game is not only fun but also a powerful learning tool.  

## Preparing a play session
The **teachers must know the game** at least once: it's better to play all the quests to be played in classroom some days before. 
It's better to have read all the topics / cards / quest record to help kids in difficulty.
The post activity can be prepared.

## Play sessions in the classroom

### Introduce the purpose

Before starting, explain to students:  

- _The game will help you learn new words and aspects of culture..._  
- _You will explore this topic by playing this level of the game..._  

### Explain how to play
It could be useful for the teacher to play the tutorial on a big screen and let all kids see how to play and what they must do.

### Playing modes  

#### 1. Class-wide game exploration

- Use a **projector or shared screen**.  
- Teacher plays or invites students to take turns.  
- Pause at key moments to:  
    - ask _what would you do next?_  
    - highlight cultural or linguistic points.  
- Excellent for **whole-class discussions**.  
- Tip: start with the **Tutorial** quest together.  

> [!tip] Example prompt
> “We’ve found a bakery — what clues tell us it’s important in French culture?”  

#### 2. Individual play / independent learning

- Students play on their own devices for a fixed time (say 20 minutes).  
- Activate **Classroom Mode**: disables background music and allows to choose freely the quest to play.  
- Objective: finish a quest or stop at time limit.  
- Benefits: self-paced learning, hidden secrets encourage replay.  

> [!tip] Teacher tip
> Give a micro-goal like “unlock 2 cards and take a screenshot of your Book”.  

#### 3. Group play / pair learning

- Students play in pairs or small groups.  
- One controls, others support with ideas or solving puzzles.  
- Rotate roles regularly.  
- Benefits: teamwork, communication, peer support.  

Variation: Assign roles (navigator, reader, controller) and swap every 5 minutes.  

**Tips for teachers**

- Before play (2 minutes): preview the quest objective and key vocabulary
- During play: have a “navigator” read the objective while the “driver” controls; swap roles at checkpoints.  
- After play (5 minutes): open the Book, pick 1–2 unlocked cards, and map connections on the board (what it relates to and why).  
- Differentiation: let advanced students hunt for optional tasks/cards while others follow the main path.  

#### 4. Homework play

- Assign a quest to be played at home.  
- Next session, hold a discussion about what they discovered.  

> [!tip] Home reflection prompt
> “Tell a family member one new word and where you saw it.”

## Post game and debrief activities

### Words

> [!tip] Pronunciation activity
> Students repeat after a Living Letter, then use the word in a sentence related to the quest.  

> [!tip] Explain a card
> After play, ask learners to open the Book and explain one card to a peer.  

> [!tip] Bonus Malus
> Citizenship link: Discuss how in‑game choices mirror respectful behavior in real life.  

> [!tip] world map
> For homework, let students explore in Home mode and bring one new card to share.  


Reflection after play helps consolidate learning.  

### Reflection questions

**Generic**:  

- What new words or phrases did you learn?  
- What was the most challenging part?  
- How did the game help you understand this culture?  

**Specific examples**:  

- What is _Notre Dame de Paris_?  
- How is a _Baguette_ made?  

**Group discussion**  

- Invite students to share favorite moments.  
- Connect in-game discoveries to curriculum topics or personal experiences.  

**Reflection and journaling**  

- Encourage students to keep a **Game Journal** (short notes or drawings).  
- Promotes metacognition: they think critically about what they learned.  

Quick write (3 minutes): “One thing I learned, one question I still have.”

## Post game activities

**4. Research and Google Maps activity**  

- After play, students research the cultural topic online.  
- Example: after exploring Paris, they can look up **Notre Dame** or use Google Maps to locate it.  
- Extends the game into **real-world discovery**.  

Extension task: find one local equivalent (e.g., a bakery or monument in your town).  

**5. Modification activity (game design thinking)**  

- Ask students how they would **improve the quest**.  
- Encourage them to invent new challenges, NPCs, or cultural puzzles.  
- Great for **creativity** and understanding how games are built.  

Example: “Add a decision where talking to an NPC politely unlocks a new clue.”  

## Play sessions at home (parents involvement)

Parents are encouraged to:  

- Play the game themselves at least once.  
- Play together with their child for 20 minutes/day.  
- Repeat sentences in both languages together.  
- Discuss discoveries in the game.  

Note: **the game can also support parents who do not speak the learning language**, as dialogues are bilingual.

## Feedback and validation of quests

Teacher and parent feedback is essential to improve quests.  
Check the [Support page](./support.md) also.  

### How to give feedback

- Each quest has a **dedicated page on the website** with content summaries.  
- Teachers can leave comments and suggestions in the **forum**.  
- Feedback may include:  
  - Accuracy of cultural content  
  - Appropriateness of language level  
  - Suggestions for new activities or improvements  
  - Observations from student reactions  

### Quest validation in classroom

- When using a quest with students, teachers are invited to **report back**:  
  - Did students understand the content?  
  - Which parts worked best?  
  - Which challenges were too easy or too difficult?  
  - Did the quest align with the curriculum?  

### Contribution and collaboration

- Even without technical skills, teachers can suggest **topics, cards, and words** that are valuable for their classroom
- Teachers who wish to contribute more deeply can join the [Antura community](https://antura.discourse.group/) to co-design or adapt quests... or even propose new ones!
