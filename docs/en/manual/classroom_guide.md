# Classroom Guide

This guide provides some practical suggestions for teachers using **Learn with Antura** in class, including the following steps:  

1. Preparing a play session.  
2. Introducing a play session.  
3. Playing in the classroom.
4. Post session debrief and activities.
5. Providing feedback to help improve the game.  

This approach creates a **virtuous loop of play → reflection → feedback → improvement**, ensuring the game is not only fun but also a powerful learning tool.  

## Preparing a play session

The **teachers must know the game**: they should play every didactical unit at least once before introducing it in classroom. This is valid for both modules so the didactical unit couls be either a series of language learning minigames or a cultural quest. It would be even better if teachers could take the time to read all the didactical unit content (either letters and words or topics and cards) to be able to help kids in case of need and to prepare in advace a post session activity.
Moreover, teachers should check regularly (i.e. once a week) if a new version of the game is available in order to always use the latest version. 

### Planning the sessions

We recommend to alternate the 2 modules (Learn Language and Discover Culture) dedicating a session to the first module and the next session to the second one. 

## Introducing a play session

Once in the classroom, before starting to play, teachers should explain to the students what they are going to play and why.   

- _The game will help you learn new words or some aspects of culture..._  
- _You will explore this topic by playing this quest..._  

> [!Reminder]
> Remeber to set properly the class in the Teachers Area, to always give the same device to each student (so they have their profile to select) and to select the correct native language for each kid.

## Playing in the classroom

### Explaining how to play

Ensuring that all kids know how to play is very important, especially in the first play sessions when they have not familiarized with the game yet. 

> [!TIP]
> It would be great if the teacher could play the tutorial on a big screen and let all kids see how to play and what they are supposed to do. If it's not possible, all kids should play the tutorial indivually and the teacher should supervise the session, helping all kids who need guidance.

### Individual play 

Within the mark of the [ANTURA Erasmus+ project](../about/erasmus/index.md) testing, we will focus on individual play (one kid, one device) but the game could be projected for the whole class (on a big screen) or it could be played in small groups (i.e. in pairs).

With individual play, students play on "their own" devices for a fixed time (say 20-25 minutes).  
The objective is to complete a didactical unit, but teachers should stop the session if it reaches the time limit (a playing session should never last more then 30 minutes).
This way each student can play and learn at his/her own pace and even replay some content to improve the score or to find all hidden bonuses.  

> [!tip] 
> Teachers can guide and motivate students by giving them additional sub-goals (i.e. “unlock 2 cards and take a screenshot of your Book”).  

## Post session debrief and activities

To reinforce the learning outcome, we recommend the following interactions after the end of a play session.

### Vocabulary

Recap and practice with the words learned during the session.

> [!tip] Pronunciation activity
> Students repeat after a Living Letter, then use the word in a sentence related to the quest.  

> [!tip] Explain a card
> After play, ask learners to open the Book and explain one card to a peer.  

### Reflection

Reflecting after play helps consolidate learning. 
Here's a list of sample questions to stimulate the reflection:  

**Generic**:  

- What new words or phrases did you learn?  
- What was the most challenging part?  
- How did the game help you understand this culture?  

**Specific examples**:  

- What is _Notre Dame de Paris_?  
- How is a _Baguette_ made?  

**Group discussion**  

- Invite students to share favorite moments.  
- Connect in-game discoveries to curriculum topics or personal experiences.  

**Reflection and journaling**  

- Encourage students to keep a **Game Journal** (short notes or drawings).  
- Promotes metacognition: they think critically about what they learned.  

Quick write (3 minutes): “One thing I learned, one question I still have.”  

### Post session activities

**Research and Google Maps activity**  

- After play, students research the cultural topic online.  
- Example: after exploring Paris, they can look up **Notre Dame** or use Google Maps to locate it.  
- Extends the game into **real-world discovery**.  

Extension task: find one local equivalent (e.g., a bakery or monument in your town).  

**Modification activity (game design thinking)**  

- Ask students how they would **improve the quest**.  
- Encourage them to invent new challenges, NPCs, or cultural puzzles.  
- Great for **creativity** and understanding how games are built.  

Example: “Add a decision where talking to an NPC politely unlocks a new clue.”  

## Feedback about cultural quests

Teachers feedback is essential to improve the game content.  
Check the [Support page](./support.md) also.  

### How to give feedback 

- Each cultural quest has a **dedicated page on the website** with content summaries.  
- Teachers can leave comments and suggestions in the **forum**.  
- Feedback may include:  
  - Accuracy of cultural content  
  - Appropriateness of language level  
  - Suggestions for new activities or improvements  
  - Observations from student reactions  

### Quest validation in classroom

- When using a quest with students, teachers are invited to **report back**:  
  - Did students understand the content?  
  - Which parts worked best?  
  - Which challenges were too easy or too difficult?  
  - Did the quest align with the curriculum?  

### Contribution and collaboration

- Even without technical skills, teachers can suggest **topics, cards, and words** that are valuable for their classroom
- Teachers who wish to contribute more deeply can join the [Antura community](https://antura.discourse.group/) to co-design or adapt quests... or even propose new ones!
