With a flash of light from Neptune's trident, the Lighthouse beam turns on in the distance.

**Conclusion - The Final Lesson:**
The player wins the race, reaching the seals just in time to block Antura, who then scampers away. The fisherman walks over.

### Resources
**Gdańsk Nowy Port Lighthouse:** historic 19th century structure, built in 1894, that used to guide ships into Gdansk’s harbor and was among the first lighthouses on the Baltic Sea coast to use electric light. It’s currently open to visitors as a museum and offers a panoramic view of the Baltic Sea and port area.

**Baltic Sea – shore in Gdańsk** (photo of Brzeźno Beach): it is known for sandy beaches, brisk sea breeze, and scenic coast. It’s a popular spot for both locals and tourists, especially during summer.
  
**Amber**: also known as Baltic Gold, is fossilized tree resin that can be found along the shores of the Baltic Sea. It can often contain ancient inclusions like insects or plant matter. It is prized for its warm hues and used to be traded along the famous Amber Road connecting northern Europe to the Mediterranean.

**The Amber Room:** world famous chamber decorated in amber panels, originally created in the 18th century by German and Gdansk-based artisans. A replica now resides in Catherine Palace near St. Petersburg, but its mysterious wartime disappearance links it forever to Gdansk’s amber trade.

**Żuraw**: medieval port crane and one of Gdansk’s most iconic landmarks. Built in the 15th century, it served both as a loading crane and a city gate along the Motława River.

Neptun’s fountain: historic fountain in Gdansk located in Gdansk’s Long Market and in front of the Main Town Hall, symbolizes the city’s connection to the sea. The statue of the sea god has stood there since the 17th century and is a popular meeting point for visitors.

Town Hall: the Main Town Hall is an example of Gothic – Renaissance architecture with a soaring tower and richly decorated interiors. It now houses the city’s historical museum and offers panoramic views from the tower.
