Let's know the neighbours of France

##  Design Notes

**Core Subject:** Geography, Flags, and European Countries.

**Player Objectives:**

1. **Flag Hunt:** The player meets a French child who explains that Antura has mixed up all the flags of the neighboring countries.
2. **Country Tour:** The player must help friends from **France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Spain, Luxembourg, and Switzerland** find their missing flags.
3. **Visual Recognition:** The player must identify flags based on descriptions (e.g., "Red with a white cross" for Switzerland, "Green, white, and red" for Italy).
4. **Chain Reaction:** Finding one flag unlocks the next country's request (e.g., helping Germany leads to Italy).
5. **Completion:** Once all 7 flags are returned, the player completes the map of this part of Europe.

**Educational Content:**

- **Geography:** Introduces the concept of **Europe** and the relative locations of France and its neighbors.
- **Flags:** Teaches the colors and patterns of 7 European flags.
- **Capitals:** Mentions capital cities like **Paris, Berlin, Rome, Brussels, Madrid, Luxembourg City, and Bern**.
- **Cultural Facts:** Includes small facts (e.g., Italy looks like a boot, Germany has castles, Spain has flamenco).
