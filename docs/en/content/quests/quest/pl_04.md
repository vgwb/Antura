## Design Notes

**Core Subject:** Animals, Logic, and Local Landmarks.

**Player Objectives:**

1. **Detective Work:** The Zoo Director tasks the player with finding the missing **Wrocław Flag**, which disappeared from the famous **Iglica** sculpture.
2. **Suspect Interviews:** The player must visit five animal suspects (Monkey, Lion, Giraffe, Elephant, Penguin) to investigate.
3. **Mini-Games:** To clear each animal's name, the player completes a specific mini-game (e.g., matching fruit for the Monkey, ordering the Lion's growth stages).
4. **Deduction:** After proving all animals are innocent (e.g., the Penguin can't fly, the Giraffe isn't tall enough), the mystery narrows down.
5. **Resolution:** The true culprit is revealed to be **Antura** , who was playing with the flag. The player returns the flag to the Iglica.

**Educational Content:**

- **Local Landmarks:** Features the **Centennial Hall** (UNESCO site) and the **Iglica** (Needle) sculpture.
- **Animal Facts:** Teaches key traits: Giraffes are tall, Elephants have memory, Lions live in prides, Penguins swim but don't fly.
- **Vocabulary:** Focuses on animal names and related terms (_Chimpanzee, Mane, Neck, Ice, Swim_).

**Mission**

The player must act as a detective to find the missing flag of Wrocław. The core gameplay involves visiting five different animal enclosures at the ZOO. To clear each animal as a suspect, the player must complete a unique, themed mini-game. After eliminating all animal suspects, the true culprit is revealed, and the player must retrieve the flag and return it to its rightful place.

**Character**

The ZOO Director: The character who gives the mission and provides information.
The Animals: An Elephant, a Giraffe, a Lion, a Monkey, and a Penguin, each with their own personality and mini-game.
