##  Design Notes

**Core Subject:** Animals, Logic, and Local Landmarks.

**Player Objectives:**

1. **Detective Work:** The Zoo Director tasks the player with finding the missing **Wrocław Flag**, which disappeared from the famous **Iglica** sculpture.
2. **Suspect Interviews:** The player must visit five animal suspects (Monkey, Lion, Giraffe, Elephant, Penguin) to investigate.
3. **Mini-Games:** To clear each animal's name, the player completes a specific mini-game (e.g., matching fruit for the Monkey, ordering the Lion's growth stages).
4. **Deduction:** After proving all animals are innocent (e.g., the Penguin can't fly, the Giraffe isn't tall enough), the mystery narrows down.
5. **Resolution:** The true culprit is revealed to be **Antura** , who was playing with the flag. The player returns the flag to the Iglica.

**Educational Content:**
