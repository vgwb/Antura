### Knowledge Content
**River Geography:**

- The Odra is the second biggest river in Poland (after the Wisła).
- The Odra flows into the Baltic Sea.
- Learn to recognize a standard European sign indicating a river

**Urban Geography (Wrocław):**

- Wrocław has over 100 bridges.
- Bridges have different functions: for cars, pedestrians (footbridges), and trains.
- Rivers are used by different boats: for tourists, for living (houseboats), and for transporting goods (barges).

### Resources
**Rędziński Bridge**: Rędziński Bridge is the longest cable-stayed bridge in Poland, stretching across the Oder. It plays an important role in the city’s ring road system. Its modern design makes it a landmark of contemporary Wrocław.

**Tumski Bridge**: Tumski Bridge is famous for love padlocks and connects Ostrów Tumski with the city center. It’s a romantic spot for couples. In the evenings, it’s lit with gas lanterns.

**Cargo Barage**: A cargo barge is a flat-bottomed boat used to transport goods along rivers. These barges are still seen on the Oder today. They are essential for inland water transport.

**Kayaks**: Kayaks are popular for exploring Wrocław’s waterways and getting close to nature. Many people rent them for relaxing weekend trips. Paddling offers a peaceful view of the city from the water.

**Tourist Boats**: A tourist boat cruises the Oder River, offering scenic views of the city’s landmarks. It’s a great way to learn about Wrocław’s history. Guided tours are available in several languages.
