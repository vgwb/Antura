Location: France - Marseille

Visit the vibrant Old Port of Marseille! Learn polite French phrases as you shop for the ingredients to a famous local dish, bouillabaisse.

##  Design Notes

**Core Subject:** Food, Commerce, and Social Etiquette.

**Player Objectives:**

1. **Culinary Mission:** The player meets a Chef who wants to prepare a traditional **Bouillabaisse** (fish stew) but lacks the ingredients.
2. **Market Exploration:** The player must visit four different vendors (Baker, Fishmonger, Cheesemonger, Greengrocer) to find specific items like **fish, bread, tomatoes, and olive oil**.
3. **Social Interaction:** To succeed, the player must use polite greetings ("Bonjour", "Merci") and select the correct items from each vendor's list.
4. **Financial Literacy:** The player pays for items using a mini-game that simulates counting money (Euros).
5. **Final Preparation:** After collecting all 9 ingredients, the player returns to the Chef to match the ingredients to their source (e.g., Fish comes from the Fishmonger) and "cook" the final dish.

**Educational Content:**

- **Cultural Dish:** Introduces _Bouillabaisse_ as a famous specialty of Marseille.
- **Vocabulary:** Focuses on food items (_Fish, Crab, Bread, Milk, Oil, Tomato, Lemon_) and professions (_Baker, Grocer, Fishmonger_).
- **Social Skills:** Reinforces the importance of politeness (greeting before asking) and basic commerce (exchanging money for goods).
