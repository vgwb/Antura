## Design Notes

**Core Subject:** Geography, Flags, and Neighboring Countries.

**Player Objectives:**

1. **Flag Hunt:** The player meets a Polish child who explains that Antura has mixed up all the flags of the neighboring countries.
2. **Country Tour:** The player must help friends from **Poland, Germany, Belarus, Czech Republic, Lithuania, Ukraine, Slovakia, and Russia** find their missing flags.
3. **Visual Recognition:** The player must identify flags based on descriptions (e.g., "White, red and blue with a coat of arms" for Slovakia, "Red and green with a red pattern" for Belarus).
4. **Chain Reaction:** Finding one flag unlocks the next country's request (e.g., helping Poland leads to Germany).
5. **Completion:** Once all 8 flags are returned, the player completes the map of this part of Central Europe.

**Educational Content:**

- **Geography:** Introduces the concept of **Central Europe** and the relative locations of Poland and its neighbors.
- **Flags:** Teaches the colors and patterns of 8 European flags.
- **Capitals:** Mentions capital cities like **Warsaw, Berlin, Minsk, Prague, Vilnius, Kyiv, Bratislava, and Moscow**.
