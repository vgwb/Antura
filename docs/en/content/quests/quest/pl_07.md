discover who Nicolaus Copernicus was and how he revolutionised science.
And did you know he was from poland?

### Knowledge
Nicolaus Copernicus and the life of a scientist in the renaissance  

- How does the telescope work?
- The 8 planets of the solar system and their names and order

### Flow
You arrive in Toruń, meeting the guide who welcomes you. He says that apparently Antura got stuck in Nicolaus Copernicus’ house and we need to help him. To do that, you first talk with Nicolaus Kopernik outside of his house – he introduces himself and says that he will help you if you help him first. He says that there is a map of a solar system that needs fixing.  
He asks you to put the planets in the correct order (ACTIVITY ORDER).  
When you do, he explains how people used to think that Earth was in the center of it and how he created the model of the Solar System that has the Sun in the center. You go with him inside of the house looking for Antura. You follow his trail and pass a telescope.  
Copernicus explains what that is and mentions what a planetarium is as well. Eventually you find Antura and take him out of there. Copernicus says he’s glad everything is okay and tells you about himself, who he is, what he’s known for.
