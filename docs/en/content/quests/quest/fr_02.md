## Design Notes
## Game Design Notes

The cat goes to different places until he finds his school. Then he visits the school and finds his class.

### Content
School system : the cats goes a lycée (16-18 ans), to a collège (11-15 ans), to a école maternelle (3-5 ans) and finally goes to an école primaire (6-10 ans), that corresponds to his age, called Jules Verne

A typical day at school

- Morning childcare = garderie du matin
- arrival at the school gate = le portail
- work in class with different subjects/matières : maths, reading & writing
- morning playtime (récréation) on the playground (la cour) 
- lunch at the canteen (la cantine) or at home (à la maison)
- school work with different subjects/matières : PE = EPS (éducation physique et - sportive),  hist/geog = histoire/géographie,  science = sciences, arts= art
- evening childcare = garderie du soir / homework support = aide aux devoirs

School levels with level names and age (CP–6 ans / CE1-7 ans / CE2-8 ans /CM1-9 ans / CM2–10 ans).

### Knowledge content
The French School System: Kids learn the names, age groups, and order of the main schools:

- École Maternelle (3-5 years old)
- École Primaire (6-10 years old) - 5 years total.
