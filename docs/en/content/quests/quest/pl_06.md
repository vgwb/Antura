## Design Notes

**Core Subject:** Food, Commerce, and Social Etiquette.

**Player Objectives:**

1. **Culinary Mission:** The player meets a Cook who wants to prepare traditional **Toruń Gingerbread** but lacks the ingredients.
2. **Market Exploration:** The player must visit five different vendors to find specific items like
   - Grocer - flour, sugar
   - Bee keeper - honey
   - Cheese Monger - butter
   - Egg Vendor - egg
   - Spice vendore - spices (cinnamon, ginger)
3. **Social Interaction:** To succeed, the player must use polite greetings ("Dzień dobry", "Dziękuję") and select the correct items from each vendor's list.
4. **Financial Literacy:** The player pays for items using a mini-game that simulates counting money (Złoty).
5. **Final Preparation:** After collecting all 8 ingredients, the player returns to the Cook to bake the gingerbread, and is allowed to enter the Old Town Hall
6. **Cleaning the Hall** for the Pierogi Festival

**Educational Content:**

- **Cultural Dish:** Introduces _Toruń Gingerbread_ and _Pierogi_ as famous Polish specialties.
- **Vocabulary:** Focuses on food items (_Cloves, Cinnamon, Ginger, Honey, Milk, Butter, Eggs, Flour_) and professions (_Grocer, Beekeeper, Dairy Vendor_).
- **Social Skills:** Reinforces the importance of politeness (greeting before asking) and basic commerce (exchanging money for goods).
