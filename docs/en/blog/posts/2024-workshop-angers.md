# Workshops in Angers, France

In January 2024, the ANTURA project team organized a series of impactful workshops in Angers, France, bringing together educators, parents, and children from diverse backgrounds. This event marked a significant milestone in the project's development, focusing on gathering insights and feedback to refine the educational game designed to support the integration of refugee and migrant children.
Workshop Overview

The workshops were meticulously organized by a dedicated team, including Lucie Durand, Anne Du Merle, and Nadia Maillard from Angers, along with international collaborators Franziska Funken from Cologne Game Lab, Germany, and Stefano Cecere from Videojuegos Sin Fronteras, Spain. The sessions were held over two days, during which the team engaged directly with children and their families from Ukraine, Syria, Romania, and Tunisia, among others.
Activities and Insights

## Day 1:
The first day involved visits to local schools, where the team observed language lessons and interacted with children and their parents. These interactions provided valuable feedback on how the ANTURA game could be tailored to meet the specific needs of these children, many of whom expressed a strong interest in video games, including more complex titles like Roblox and Minecraft.

## Day 2:
The second day focused on in-depth discussions with educators and mediators, who provided crucial input on how the game could be integrated into the classroom setting. The team also explored the living conditions of some participants, gaining a deeper understanding of the challenges these children face daily.

Key Outcomes

The workshops led to several important conclusions that will shape the future development of the ANTURA game:

- **Game Content**: Children enjoyed the customizable features of the ANTURA game, particularly the minigames. However, there was a clear need for the game to be more accessible, considering the varying attention spans and literacy levels of the children.
- **Parental Involvement**: Parents were highly supportive of the project and saw the game as a valuable tool not only for their children but potentially for themselves as well.
- **Educational Feedback**: Educators emphasized the need for a "classroom mode" with customizable Didactical Units, quieter sound effects, and a clear structure to facilitate classroom use. They also highlighted the importance of including cultural topics, such as geography and school life, in the game's content.

## Future Directions

The feedback from these workshops will be instrumental in guiding the next stages of the ANTURA project. Plans are already in motion for a follow-up meeting in Angers, where the team will continue testing the game with the same families, ensuring continuity and building on the trust established during these initial sessions.

This collaborative effort in Angers underscores the project's commitment to creating a meaningful educational tool that resonates with its young users and their families. The ANTURA team is more motivated than ever to refine and expand the game, ensuring it serves as a powerful resource for integrating refugee and migrant children into their new communities.
