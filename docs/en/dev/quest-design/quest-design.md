# Design Discover Quests

Any Quest of the Discover Module is composed of a Unity Scene and an Yarn script.

## Design Doc
We always start with a Design Doc (usually Google Doc) with these important content:

- **Title**:
- **Description**: short introduction 
- **Knowledge Content**: what will the player learn / what answers will be able to give?
- **Mission**: what the player must do finish the quest (gameplay / objective)
- **Characters**: who will we talk to?
- **Assets**: what 3D / images / sound do we need for this quest?
- **Environment**: where does the play take place?
- **Story / Flow**: detailed description of the gamplay


## Unity

### QuestData
`QuestData` must be added to the `/Discover/_data/` folder and then to the QuestsList (to be listed)

### Scene
A scene has all the standard prefabs and these two main Game Objects:

**World**  
(all static / common 3D assets), that can be shared among different quests

**Quest**  
that has all the dynamic elements of this quest

### Components
**ActionManager**  
Is added to the Level GO.

**Interactables**
this is the main component to add to and interative object.
it can triggers Homer Nodes or Unity Actions

## Assets
We can use any of these 3D assets: <https://kenney.nl/assets/category:3D?sort=update>    
Most of them are already prefabs in the Unity Project

We can also use monuments assets from the game [Hexplorando](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2736590/Hexplorando/)

The 3D assets must be **low-poly**, flat textures.

All assets must stay inside the Quest folder.

### Images
We need small images.
These are the formats:

- JPG 85% quality or PNG (if alpha is needed)
- 256 px for small icons
- 512 px for medium icons / small images
- 1024 px for big mages
(dmensions are for the shorter side)
let's use multiple of 4 for dimensions

let's register the original url of the image in the Source field of AssetData

## Translations and Audio

The default language is english.  
We'll make all translations and validations.
And later we'll create all the voice overs.


## Script writing
