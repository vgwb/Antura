# Antura Analytics

We have a page on what we would like to track from data: <https://docs.antura.org/GameDesign/DataAnalysis.html> and here everything we log locally in the app: <https://docs.antura.org/Modules/Logging.html>

To access the online analytics: [Antura Unity Analytics Dashboard](https://dashboard.unity3d.com/organizations/567035/projects/ca7a3389-ec6c-44b1-a44d-aa0da4930165/overview?viewMode=project)

## Unity Analytics
In Antura we use Unity Analytics <https://docs.unity.com/analytics/>, which offer many default / standard game tracking data, like:

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| DAU | Number of unique players per day |
|DAU (new vs. returning)|Percent of DAU who were new on that day |
| WAU | Number of unique players in the previous seven days|
|MAU | Number of unique players in the previous 30 days |
| DAU per MAU | Percentage of MAU who played on a particular day (DAU/MAU)|
|New users | Daily users who are new that day |
|Session length |Time elapsed from when the user starts the app, and exits|
|Number of sessions|Number of sessions played that day|
|Sessions per user|Average number of sessions for each user|
|Total daily play time|Total playing time of all players on that day|
|Daily play time per DAU|Average playing time of users playing on that day|
|Day 1 retention|Percentage of users who returned to your game after one day|
|Day 7 retention|Percentage of users who returned to your game after one week|
|Day 30 retention|Percentage of users who returned to your game after 30 days|

And we added some custom event to track our players progression in the game and the gameplay.    
Unity Analytics (the new beta version we are enabled to use) has also an SQL Data Export to create custom queries (<https://docs.unity.com/analytics/SQLDataExplorer.html>)

## Environments
we have two environments:
- **production** (published apps)
