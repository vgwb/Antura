# Learn with Antura project and Discover Framework

## Overview

_Learn with Antura_ is an open educational game ecosystem designed to support learning through exploration, interaction and narrative.  
Originally created to support language learning for children in fragile contexts, the project has evolved into a modular framework that can be adapted to multiple educational domains, age groups and cultural contexts.

At the core of this evolution is the **Discover Framework**, a reusable and extensible system that allows educators and designers to create new interactive learning experiences.

## What Antura is today

Today Antura is:

- A self-learning playable educational game used in formal and informal learning contexts  
- A content driven exploration experience built around places, characters and missions  
- A framework for creating new educational games using the same core systems

Current content includes:

- 9 Languages to learn  
- Multiple countries and cultural contexts  
- Dozens of quests and activities  
- Multilingual support  
- Narrative driven missions combined with interactive tasks

## 4. The Discover Framework

The Discover Framework is the technological and design backbone of Antura.

It is a **framework for building educational games*- based on exploration and discovery.

Players explore a virtual world, interact with characters, objects and environments, and unlock knowledge through missions and activities.

Learning is embedded into gameplay rather than delivered as isolated exercises.

## 5. Key building blocks

The framework is composed of interconnected systems that can be reused and recombined.

### 5.1 Worlds and Environments

- Immersive 3D exploratory spaces  
- Modular environments that can represent real places or fictional contexts  
- Support for narrative progression and free exploration

### 5.2 Quests

- Structured learning objectives presented as missions (quests)  
- Single task or multi step progression  
- Adaptable to different subjects and difficulty levels

### 5.3 Activities

- Interactive learning units embedded in the world  
- Can include quizzes, puzzles or mini games  
- Reusable across different quests and worlds

### 5.4 Knowledge Units

- Atomic pieces of content such as words, concepts, facts or skills  
- Linked to activities and quests  
- Can be localized and reused across projects

### 5.5 Characters and Dialogue

- Non player characters guide the learner  
- Dialogue driven interactions  
- Support for branching conversations and adaptive feedback

## 6. Educational Design Principles

The Discover Framework is based on established learning design approaches:

- Learning by doing  
- Contextualized knowledge  
- Progressive challenge  
- Immediate feedback  
- Intrinsic motivation

The system is designed to support formal curricula as well as informal learning.

## 7. Technology overview

- Built with Unity, an industry standard game technology  
- Cross platform by design  
- Modular architecture to support extensions  
- Open data driven content structure

The framework separates:

- Core systems  
- Content definitions  
- Presentation and assets

This allows new content to be created without modifying the core engine.

## 8. Open Source and modularity

The project is developed with open source principles.

This enables:

- Transparency  
- Community contributions  
- Long term sustainability  
- Institutional reuse  
- Open content

Open Content means that all the digital content, dialogs, knowledge cards of the quests are freely browsable from the public website, like [https://antura.org/en/content/](https://antura.org/en/content/) 

This openness applies not only to code, but also to educational content, narrative scripts, translations and audio assets.

Partners can:

- Fork and customize the framework  
- Contribute new modules  
- Build proprietary content on top of an open core

## 9. Current state of development

As of today, the framework includes:

- A stable exploration and quest system  
- A growing library of activities  
- Multiple completed learning quests  
- Multilingual infrastructure  
- Tools for content creation and localization

The system is being tested in France and Poland schools.

The project is being developed on GitHub: [https://github.com/vgwb/Antura/](https://github.com/vgwb/Antura/)

## 10. Game designer and educator friendly tools

A key characteristic of the Antura ecosystem is that the game content is fully transparent and accessible outside the game itself. **Everything that exists in the game also exists in a browsable, reviewable and inspectable form on antura.org**

This includes:

- Quests structure and progression  
- Dialog scripts  
- Educational content and knowledge units  
- Translations in all supported languages  
- Voice over assets, including AI generated voices  
- Metadata used by the game systems

All this content is publicly visible on the website and directly connected to the game data.

This approach enables a workflow that is unusual in educational games.

### 10.1 Content review and feedback

Educators, linguists, subject matter experts and partners can:

- Read and review dialogs and scripts without running the game  
- Check translations across all supported languages  
- Listen to localized audio and voice over variants  
- Give feedback directly on texts, terminology and tone  
- Compare versions across languages and contexts

This makes pedagogical validation, linguistic review and cultural adaptation possible **before and during deployment**, not only after release.

### 10.2 Game designer friendly architecture

From a game design perspective, the Discover Framework separates:

- Game mechanics and systems  
- Narrative and dialog content  
- Educational knowledge units  
- Localization and audio assets

This allows designers and educators to work on content without touching the core codebase.

New quests, activities and learning paths can be designed, reviewed and iterated as data, using tools familiar to non programmers.

### 10.3 Teacher and classroom orientation

This transparency also supports classroom use:

- Teachers can preview learning content in advance  
- Institutions can audit materials for alignment with curricula  
- Feedback cycles can involve real educators, not only developers

The result is a shared design space where developers, designers and educators collaborate on the same artifacts.

## 11. Potential for expansion

The Discover Framework is designed to scale. 

Possible extensions include:

### 11.1 New educational domains

- Environmental education  
- Science and technology  
- Civic education  
- Cultural heritage  
- Media literacy

### 11.2 Authoring tools for educators

- Visual editors for quests and activities  
- No code content creation  
- Classroom oriented workflows

### 11.3 Online distribution

- Downloadable learning worlds  
- Shared repositories of quests  
- Community curated content

### 11.4 Classroom and multi user modes

- Teacher dashboards  
- Progress tracking  
- Collaborative exploration

### 11.5 Integration with AI tools

- Assisted content creation  
- Adaptive dialogue  
- Personalized learning paths
