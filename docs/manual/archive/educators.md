# Arabic lessons for kids

## Educational content

The pedagogical design features a stealth learning approach through game-based technology, making the learning experience more innovative and fun. As a self-learning tool, stealth learning encourages the Arabic learner to retain and apply Arabic literacy skills in his or her daily life through gameplay.

The game was playtested in an open beta phase since March 2017 and verified independently to show improvement in the educational development of children. The final version released in February 2018 is shaped by the feedback and data collected during the testing phase.

## Supported learning outcomes

Antura and the Letters is a smartphone app that teaches Arabic literacy skills. It incorporates a series of games and assessments to support numerous learning outcomes:

- Letter and sound recognition
- Decoding (letters, letter combinations, and words)
- Vocabulary

## Curriculum

The approach is a blend of phonics instruction and iterative pattern recognition. This method creates a meaningful learning experience and explains the logic behind the Arabic language. Children start with an easy introduction to patterns and letter sounds and reiterate the learning process throughout the entire alphabet. This enables kids to read words right away and have fun figuring out the puzzles within the Arabic language.

The curriculum includes:

- Arabic alphabet phonology
- Letter sounds
- Letter shapes within a word (initial, medial, final, isolated)
- Letter articulation and letter combinations (using letter sounds)
- The diacritic signs (Harakat)
- Vocabulary

## Vocabulary used in the game

The in-game vocabulary includes:

- Nouns (singular/dual/plural, feminine/masculine)
