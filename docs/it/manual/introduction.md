# Introduction
Learn with Antura is an award-winning open source game that turns reading, language, and culture into a fun adventure.
Designed specifically for migrant children, Antura can be installed on the family phone for autonomous learning or it can be used in the classroom (mainly on tablets and PCs) to help their integration a new country. Within the mark of the [ANTURA Erasmus+ project](../about/erasmus/index.md), this manual we will focus on the latter: how to test the game in the classroom, both in France and Poland, and how to provide feedback about it.

## Two Modules
The game currently supports two main learning modules, each one with a specific learning goal and an unique approach:

### Learn a Language
An introduction to a foreign language (mainly alphabet and vocabulary) playing a wide collection of minigames, progressing in a journey through 6 different worlds.

### Discover a Country and its Culture
Designed to help the integration of migrant kids in their host country, it offers a collection of Roblox-like quests. Children must complete a series of tasks, moving around and interacting in a 3D environment while learning about key concepts of the local culture.

As much as possible, the content of the each modules can reinforce the learning in the other one (i.e. you learn the name of the animals as part of the vocabulary and then you visit the zoo in 3D as part of a cultural quest).
