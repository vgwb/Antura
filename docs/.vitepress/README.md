# VitePress config

This folder contains VitePress configuration for the Antura docs.

Key points:

- Uses existing `docs/` content.
- Output dir set to `_production/site` to mirror previous hosting.
- `public/CNAME` preserves the custom domain.
- Locales are configured in `config.ts` (root English by default). Add other languages by creating subfolders like `docs/ar/` and adding a locale entry.
