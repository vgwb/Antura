##Â Game Design

After watching the famous "24 Hours of Le Mans" car race, help Cat navigate the city streets on a scooter to safely reach the train station, learning important traffic rules along the way. 

### Flow
The player must guide Cat on a scooter (trottinette) from the Le Mans racetrack to the train station. The path is linear but features four key intersections, each designed as a mini-game to teach a specific traffic rule (STOP sign, DANGER sign, traffic lights, zebra crossing). 
The player must successfully navigate these challenges while avoiding moving cars and bicycles to reach the destination.
