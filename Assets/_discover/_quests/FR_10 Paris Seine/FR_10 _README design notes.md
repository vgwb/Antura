She ask to find the 5 pages.
When we bring them back she finds the best cards to be missing... she was along the Sein river studiyng bridges and boats.. can we help her?

Now we can go along all the Sein there are 7 chests. each with someone protecting it who tells something about the place and asks a qeustion / activitiy / touch a button to open the chest

these are the 7 cards:

### boat for goods

### boat house where people live

### boat for tourists

### bridge alexandre iii

When we have collected the 7 Cards we go back to the tourist for happy end
