## Game Design Notes

Once you free Antura, you see that he got quite scared and upset. To cheer him up, you want to do something for him. The guide suggests getting him some food, since he must have been quite hungry after being stuck there for a while. You go to the food market.
The baker tells us: Antura loves Torunian ginger bread. If you want to prepare it for him, here is a list of ingredients to buy at the market. He also offers you the access to his equipment, if during the shopping you will also buy pierogi for him. You have the following coins and banknotes from the Guide: one 20zł, one 10zł, one 5zł, three 2zł, five 1zł. You won’t need to use all of the money.

You go to all market stands and talk to the vendors, who tell you what they are selling.
Example:

- I sell cloves, cinnamon, ginger. I'm a grocer.
- I sell eggs. I’m an egg vendor.
- I sell Pierogi - (cook)
- I sell fruits and vegetables. I'm a greengrocer.
- I sell honey. I’m a beekeeper.
- I sell milk and butter. I’m a dairy vendor.
After each time the player hears a sentence, the cat will be asked to confirm or cancel the purchase of that product.
When all ingredients are bought, you go back to the cook to make the gingerbread and give him pierogi.
After we manage to make the Gingerbread, Antura tells us it’s a traditional Torunian dish and thanks you for making it for him.
