# Antura secrets

in this directory we save sensible data that we don't want to be in git or in the published project (so we are in an Editor directory)

you have to create an /Editor directory and store these files there:

- Editor/Localization Google Sheet Service Scriptable Object
- Editor/Antura LocalSecrets Scriptabe Object
